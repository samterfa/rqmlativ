\item{returnResponse}{Whether to return the server response instead of the results. Useful for debugging. Default is FALSE.}

\item{fieldNames}{A TRUE or FALSE value determining whether or not to return the field for the given GraduationRequirementMN. Defaults to FALSE for all return fields which, for convenience, returns all fields for the GraduationRequirementMN.}
