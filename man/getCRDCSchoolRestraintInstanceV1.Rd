\item{CRDCSchoolRestraintInstanceV1ID}{The ID of the CRDCSchoolRestraintInstanceV1 to return.}

\item{fieldPaths}{Fields from other objects with 'Many to One' or 'One to One' relationships to the given object listed as text. Run \code{\link{getSchemaForObjects}}('CRDCSchoolRestraintInstanceV1') to get more field paths.}

\item{entityId}{The id of the entity (school). Run \code{\link{listEntities}} for a list of entities. Defaults to 1 (district).}
